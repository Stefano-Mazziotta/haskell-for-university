## Introduction to Haskell

Haskell is a functional programming language known for its concise syntax, strong static typing, and emphasis on immutability. With its powerful abstractions and elegant solutions to complex problems, Haskell remains a popular choice for both academic research and industrial development.

### 1. Functional Programming Paradigm:

- Haskell embodies the principles of functional programming.
- Functions are the primary building blocks of programs.
- Functions are first-class citizens in Haskell.

### 2. Strong Static Typing:

- Haskell features a strong static type system.
- Type inference enhances safety and expressiveness.
- Type errors are caught at compile-time.

### 3. Immutability:

- Haskell promotes immutability.
- Once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed.
- New values are created through function application.

### 4. Lazy Evaluation:

- Haskell supports lazy evaluation.
- Expressions are not evaluated until their results are needed.
- Allows for potentially infinite data structures.

### 5. Abstraction Mechanisms:

- Haskell provides powerful abstraction mechanisms.
- Type classes enable ad-hoc polymorphism.
- Algebraic data types facilitate the creation of complex data structures.
